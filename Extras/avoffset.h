 * FP_INDIR is the number of fp chain elements above 'main'.
 * AV_OFFSET is the offset of &av[0] relative to the frame pointer in 'main'.

 * If getav0() does not work on a specific architecture
 * the program which generated this include file may dump core.
 * In this case, the generated include file does not include
 * definitions for AV_OFFSET and FP_INDIR but ends after this comment.

 * which use the definitions are automatically disabled.
